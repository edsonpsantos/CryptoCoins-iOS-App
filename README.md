# CryptoCoins-iOS-App

## 📱 About this project
This project will be a cryptocurrency iOS mobile application that downloads live price data from an API and uses CoreData to save locally the current user's portfolio.

The repository contains all code based on an MVVM architecture pattern to organize the files and keep the code as efficient as possible.

##  🤔 Technologies and Features I will use:

##App features:
* Live cryptocurrency data
* Saving current user's portfolio
* Searching, Filtering, Sorting, and Reloading data

##Technical Features:

* CoreData ( saving current user's portfolio )
* Combine ( publisher and subscribes )
* FileManager ( saving images )
* Multiple API calls
* Codable (decoding JSON data )
* Multi-Threading (using background threads )
* MVVM Architecture
* Good practices ( Save coding -> if let and guard statements to avoid crashes )
